# RSVP Manager

The RSVP Response Manager is a command line application to view statistics relating to answers given by people who submitted an RSVP form, and process questions/comments received through this RSVP form. It is intended to be used by staff of organisations that hold public events.

The statistical analysis would be useful in answering question such as:
- How many people are expected to attend the event?
- How successful was the marketing of the event?
- What is the value of each employed marketing strategy?

The question/comment manager functionality is designed to provide means of responding to respondent's questions/comments via email. This feature provides a means of starting back and forth communication with individual respondents.

The RSVP response data is stored in an external Google Spreadsheet.
